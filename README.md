# Bot-Workshop
This repository contains multiple workshops using C# and .NET to build bots using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). 

You'll be able to build your first bot using State storage to store information, dialogs, cards as well as using services like [Q&A Maker](https://qnamaker.ai/) and [LUIS](https://luis.ai). Just jump [here](./First-Bot-with-Bot-Framework.md) to start.

If you're using a Mac, there are limitations using C# to fully run the bot, [go here](Bot-Builder-on-Mac.md) to get the few hacks which will make it working.

You have as well a YesNo bot which you can implement, it is using a random external API answering yes or no! You'll find [the workshop here](./Chatbot-Student-Workshop/README.md).
